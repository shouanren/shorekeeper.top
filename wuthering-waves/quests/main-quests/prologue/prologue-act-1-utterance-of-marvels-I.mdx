# Prologue Act 1 Utterance of Marvels: I

Rover is seen floating in space with an unknown entity, let's address her as Goddess. 
Everything begins the instant the Goddess retrieves something from inside the Rover's chest and transfers that to Rover's hand causing their awakening as a **Resonator** and the reveal of a **Tacet Mark**.

In the next instant we see the Goddess pushing Rover away into space as she gracefully smiles. The space started to distort with Rover being sucked into a gateway where we can see the reverberations or frequencies while they fall into a lake emitting reverberations as they touch the surface of it.

After this journey through frequencies, Rover find themself in **Solaris-3** near **Gorges of Spirits**. As they regain consciousness, they meet **Yangyang** and **Chixia**. While explaining, Rover states that they have lost their memories and don't remember anything about their past and identity. 
This is the first time where **Yangyang** and **Chixia** decide to refer them as Rover as they set off for **Jinzhou**, one of the 6 major cities in **Huanglong**.

You pass through while fighting Tacet Discords and reach in front of a huge statue, a vision appears where you and **Jue** the **Sentinel** of Jinzhou are face-to-face. Yangyang mentions that only the Sentinel's appointed Resonator is allowed in it's proximity that is the **Magistrate of Jinzhou**.

While passing through **Gorges of Spirits**, you see a person standing next to what is called a **Tacet Field** and are a companion with **Yangyang** and **Chixia** called **Baizhi**.
As Baizhi finished examining Rover, she advised to set-off for **Jinzhou** as Tacet Fields are extremely dangerous. In that event, an overlord class Tacet Discord **Crownless** emerges from it and engages Rover.

At the end of the fight as Rover emerges victorious, they absorb the reverberation of Crownless also called an **Echo** with their bare hands which is an impossible feat for any resonator.
>Resonators can only absorb echoes through **Pangu Terminal** as brought up by Yangyang, Chixia and Baizhi.


While Yangyang, Chixia and Baizhi startle in eve. You are taken aback remembering a scene with a strange entity with wings assumably a Tacet Discord. Did absorbing Crownless trigger it?
Baizhi reveals that absorbing echoes through human body is not unprecedented. 

> "A celestial being descended, commanding the Qiankun's boundless
power. Assuming mortal.form, they condensed the primordial essence,
creating Pangu. Cleaving heaven and earth apart"
 \- **Comprehensive Mirror for Historians** mentioned this in Huanglong section's opening.

While discussing the matter the gourd on Yangyang beeps, a holographic message is sent to entirety of Jinzhou from the **City Hall** by **Jinhsi*(The Magistrate of Jinzhou)***.
Jinhsi explains that as the **Moon Chasing Festival** is drawing near, Jinzhou experiences visitors and among them a **visitor** holds utmost importance to Jinhsi, Jinzhou and the entirety of Huanglong.

"We have awaited your arrival for a long time", as Jinhsi requests Rover to meet at the city hall where their questions will be answered.
